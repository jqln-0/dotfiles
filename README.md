dotfiles
========

A repository for easily moving my dotfiles about and recording changes to them.

zshrc
-----

My zshrc is just the default oh-my-zsh zshrc, with the following changes:

- GOPATH set to ~/Programming/Go
- My preferred theme set
- Some plugins enabled

vimrc
-----

My vimrc is probably a fair bit longer than it really needs to be. Possibly I
will one day get around the cleaning it up and sorting through what I really
need and don't need. You might find something interesting by browsing through
it.

terminator/config
-----------------

I've configured terminator to look more like a reasonable terminal (ie. no
crazy red title bar). The config also includes a colour scheme that closely
matches the vim-molokai colourscheme I use.
