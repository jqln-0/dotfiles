dotfiles
========

A repository for easily moving my dotfiles about and recording changes to them.

zshrc
-----

My zshrc is just the default oh-my-zsh zshrc, with the following changes:

- GOPATH set to ~/Programming/Go
- My preferred theme set
- Some plugins enabled

vimrc
-----

My vimrc is probably a fair bit longer than it really needs to be. Possibly I
will one day get around the cleaning it up and sorting through what I really
need and don't need. You might find something interesting by browsing through
it.

lilyterm
--------

Lilyterm is a really sweet terminal emulator! It doesn't have random unused
space that pisses me off! My config sets some sane (ie. what I like) defaults,
as well as the molokai colour scheme.
