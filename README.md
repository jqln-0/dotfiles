dotfiles
========

This is boring. You're probably not that interested.

zsh
---

My setup is basically a *very* slightly modified oh-my-zsh. pwd.zsh contains
simple code to create a fish-style pwd; ie. "~/Documents/Whatever/Somewhere"
becomes "~/D/W/Somewhere". I found it somewhere on the internet.

vim
---

My vimrc is way too long and bloated. Read at your peril.
