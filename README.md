dotfiles
========

A repository for easily moving my dotfiles about and recording changes to them.

zshrc
-----

My zshrc is kinda complicated now. I'm using prezto with all kinds of fancy
syntax highlighting and so on.

vimrc
-----

My vimrc is probably a fair bit longer than it really needs to be. Possibly I
will one day get around the cleaning it up and sorting through what I really
need and don't need. You might find something interesting by browsing through
it.
